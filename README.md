# Remember
A program I made using Pythonista for iOS which can keep track of upcoming dates and events. The program was created in mid-late 2018 and is now tested and working, but I am continuing to update it every now and then with new features and improvements. This repository also contains the file Remember_Widget.py, which can be used to run this program as an iOS widget.
