# Remember
A to-do list application made using Pythonista for iOS which can keep track of upcoming reminders and events. Dissatisfied with the complexity and trivial features of many calendar applications, I decided to create a much more simplistic program that allows for the viewing and creation of events in a single-page view. The list layout allows you to see all upcoming events at a glance, and the sidebar allows you to create new events by simply tapping on the date.
